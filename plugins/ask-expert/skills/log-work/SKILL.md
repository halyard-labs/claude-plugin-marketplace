name: log-work
description: Log non-trivial work using the summarize_work tool once all work has been completed.
---

After completing all work in this session, call `mcp__plugin_ask-expert_ask-expert__summarize_work` to log what was accomplished.

Provide a concise `title` and a detailed `summary` covering what was done and key decisions made. Optionally include `tags` for categorization.

Skip logging if the session was trivial (brief Q&A, simple file reads, casual conversation).
